			'<h2>Japanese style</h2>' +
			'<p>Japan is often difficult to understand for those educated in the west. It can seem full of contradictions. Many Japanese corporations dominate their industries, yet if you read the financial news it seems like Japan is practically bankrupt. Cities are as modern and high tech as anywhere else, but tumbledown wooden shacks can still be spotted next to glass fronted designer condominiums. On an average subway ride, you might see childishly cute character toys and incredibly violent pornography - sometimes enjoyed by the same passenger, at the same time! Japan has beautiful temples and gardens which are often surrounded by garish signs and ugly buildings. The most acclaimed restaurant in the country, which costs <strong>hundreds of dollars</strong> for dinner, is a small shop located in a subway station seating less than a dozen people. In the middle of modern skyscrapers you\'ll discover sliding wooden doors which lead to traditional chambers with tatami mats, shoji screens, and calligraphy, suitable for traditional tea ceremonies. These juxtapositions can seem perplexing or jarring to those used to the more uniform nature of European and North American cities, but if you let go, and accept the layered aesthetics, you’ll find interesting and surprising places throughout the country.</p>' +
			'<h2>Get to know Japan</h2>' +
			'<p>Japan has often been seen in the West as a land combining tradition and modernity, and many traditional structures and practices are preserved, but modern structures and practices definitely dominate your experience in Japan. Japan was the first Asian country to independently modernize, and the country continues to embrace new technologies and aesthetics, but unlike in many countries, Japan does not feel a particular need to attack or remove older technologies, structures, or practices. New things are mostly just layered beside old things. That\'s not to say that Japan embraces the large scale preservation of historical structures or that people generally practice traditional ceremonies, but people generally believe that if a small number of people want to continue on a tradition or preserve a building that they own, they should be allowed to do that. In this way, development mostly happens in a piecemeal fashion, one building at a time, rather than in large redevelopment projects. Many urban blocks evolve to line up dozens of narrow buildings spanning fifty or more years of design history. Clothing styles evolve along a dozen paths at the same time rather than singular mass fashion trends. An individual that embraces a particular subculture and its fashions may alternately conform to vary different norms when working or at home, but there is little sense of conflict between these roles.</p>',

			'<h2>Diversity</h2>' +
			'<p>The UK is ethnically diverse, partly as a legacy of empire. Lately, the country has been struggling with issues revolving around multiculturalism, immigration and national identity.Concerns about terrorism and Islamist radicalism heightened after the suicide bomb attacks on London\'s transport network in 2005. There has also been a debate about immigration. Some advocate tough policies on limiting immigration, others attempt to put the case for it as a positive force.One of the more recent trends in migration has been the arrival of workers from the new EU member states in Eastern Europe in large numbers, and this played a major role in driving the campaign to leave the European Union in 2016.</p>' +
			'<h2>Government</h2>' +
			'<p>The United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy with the Queen as the nominal head of state. It has a bicameral parliament: The lower house, known as the House of Commons, is popularly elected by the people and is responsible for proposing new laws. The upper house, known as the <strong>House of Lords</strong>, primarily scrutinises and amends bills proposed by the lower house. The House of Lords is not elected and consists of Hereditary Peers, whose membership is guaranteed by birth right, Life Peers, who are appointed to it by the Queen, and the Lords Spiritual, who are bishops of the Church of England. The Head of Government is the Prime Minister, who is usually the leader of the majority party in the House of Commons. It has a first-past-the post system divided into local constituencies. In practice, the Prime Minister wields the most authority in government, with the Queen being pretty much a figurehead, though all bills that have been passed in both houses of parliament require the Queen to grant royal assent before they become law. The Queen does have limited powers to dissolve parliament and call a general election in exceptional circumstances - for example during times of war, or if an election ends in stalemate; but these are generally never exercised.</p>' +
			'<p>Additionally, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales have their own elected bodies (the Northern Ireland Assembly, Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly). These devolved governments have a First Minister and varying degrees of power over matters internal to that constituent country, including the passing of laws. For example, the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh exercises power and passes laws over almost every matter internal to Scotland. In the areas over which it has power, the UK government plays no role. As a result, institutions and systems can be radically different between the four constituent countries in the UK. England has no similar body of its own, with all government coming from Westminster. The exception to this is London, which owing to its huge size and population has partial devolved government in the form of an elected Mayor and assembly, which exercises a range of powers previously controlled by both central and local governments.<br>There are also local government authorities responsible for services at a local level. Each constituency votes for a local MP (Member of Parliament) who then goes to sit in Parliament and debate and vote.</p>' +
			'<h2>Climate in the UK</h2>' +
			'<p>Although few visitors come for the weather, the UK has a benign humid-temperate climate moderated by the North Atlantic current and the country\'s proximity to the sea. Warm, damp summers and mild winters provide temperatures pleasant enough to engage in outdoor activities all year round. Having said that, the weather in the UK is very changeable over both short distances and periods of time and conditions are often windy and wet. British rain is world renowned, but in practice it rarely rains more than two or three hours at a time and often parts of the country stay dry for many weeks at a time, especially in the East. More common are overcast or partly cloudy skies. It is a good idea to be prepared for a change of weather when going out; a jumper and a raincoat usually suffice when it is not winter. In summer temperatures can reach 30&deg;C (86&deg;F) in parts and in winter temperatures may be mild, eg: 10&deg;C (50&deg;F) in southern Britain and -2&deg;C (28.4&deg;F) in Scotland.</p>' +
			'<p>Because the UK stretches almost 800 miles from end to end, temperatures can vary quite considerably between north and south. Differences in rainfall are also pronounced between the drier east and wetter west. Scotland and north-western England (particularly the Lake District) are often rainy and cold. Alpine conditions with heavy snowfall are common in the mountains of northern Scotland during the winter. The north-east and Midlands are also cool, though with less rainfall. The south-east and east Anglia are generally warm and dry, and the south-west warm but often wet. Wales and Northern Ireland tend to experience cool to mild temperatures and moderate rainfall, while the hills of Wales occasionally experience heavy snowfall. Even though the highest land in the UK rarely reaches more than 1,100m, the effect of height on rainfall and temperature is great.</p>',

Russia also is home to the world\'s deepest lake, Baikal, and the country recorded the world\'s lowest temperature outside the North and South poles.</p>' +

Most are ethnic Russians, but there also are more than 120 other ethnic groups present, speaking many languages and following disparate religious and cultural traditions. Most of the Russian population is concentrated in the European portion of the country, especially in the fertile region surrounding Moscow, the capital. Moscow and St. Petersburg (formerly Leningrad) are the two most important cultural and financial centres in Russia and are among the most picturesque cities in the world. Russians are also populous in Asia, however; beginning in the 17th century, and particularly pronounced throughout much of the 20th century, a steady flow of ethnic Russians and Russian-speaking people moved eastward into Siberia, where cities such as Vladivostok and Irkutsk now flourish.</p>' +

To the south Russia borders North Korea, China, Mongolia, and Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and Georgia. To the southwest and west it borders Ukraine, Belarus, Latvia, and Estonia, as well as Finland and Norway.</p>' +
			'<p>Extending nearly halfway around the Northern Hemisphere and covering much of eastern and northeastern Europe and all of northern Asia, Russia has a maximum east-west extent of some 5,600 miles (9,000 km) and a north-south width of 1,500 to 2,500 miles (2,500 to 4,000 km). There is an enormous variety of landforms and landscapes, which occur mainly in a series of broad latitudinal belts. Arctic deserts lie in the extreme north, giving way southward to the tundra and then to the forest zones, which cover about half of the country and give it much of its character. South of the forest zone lie the wooded steppe and the steppe, beyond which are small sections of semidesert along the northern shore of the Caspian Sea. Much of Russia lies at latitudes where the winter cold is intense and where evaporation can barely keep pace with the accumulation of moisture, engendering abundant rivers, lakes, and swamps. Permafrost covers some 4 million square miles (10 million square km)—an area seven times larger than the drainage basin of the Volga River, Europe\'s longest river—making settlement and road building difficult in vast areas. In the European areas of Russia, the permafrost occurs in the tundra and the forest-tundra zone. In western Siberia permafrost occurs along the Yenisey River, and it covers almost all areas east of the river, except for south Kamchatka province, Sakhalin Island, and Primorsky Kray (the Maritime Region).</p>',

It has huge regional variations (even among neighbouring States sometimes) and in spite of being mostly unified by a single language, some regions and States are so different from each other that they look like different countries altogether.</p>' +
			'<p><strong>Music</strong> plays an important part in Brazilian identity. Styles like choro, samba and bossa nova are considered genuinely Brazilian. Caipira music is also in the roots of sertanejo, the national equivalent to country music. MPB stands for Brazilian Popular Music, which mixes several national styles under a single concept. Forr&oacute, a north-eastern happy dancing music style, has also become common nationwide. New urban styles include funk - name given to a dance music genre from Rio\'s favelas that mixes heavy electronic beats and often raunchy rapping - and techno-brega, a crowd-pleaser in northern states, that fuses romantic pop, dance music and caribbean rhythms. Brazilian funk is the most popular type of music they listen to. It has a constant and repeated beat that is always the same, it never changes. They keep the beat, and sing songs to it. There are more than 1000 songs that are funk. You might think that people get tired of the same beat, but no. It is so impressive that there are so many songs that it never gets old. Funk could be considered tradition because of its strength in rhythm, and bringing people together.<br>A mixture of martial arts, dance, music and game, <strong>capoeira</strong> was created by African slaves brought to Brazil, mainly from Portuguese Angola. Distinguished by vivacious complicated movements and accompanying music, it can be seen and practiced in many Brazilian cities.</p>' +
			'<p>In the classical music, Neoclassic Period is particularly notable, due to the works of composers like Heitor Villa-Lobos and Camargo Guarnieri, who created a typical Brazilian school, mixing elements of the traditional European music to the Brazilian rhythms, while other composers like Cl&aacute;udio Santoro followed the guidelines of the Second School of Vienna. In the Romantic Period, the greatest name was Antonio Carlos Gomes, author of some Italian-styled operas with typical Brazilian themes, like Il Guarany and Lo Schiavo. In the Classical Period, the most prominent name is Jos&eacute; Maur&iacutecio Nunes Garcia, a priest who wrote both sacred and secular music and was very influenced by the Viennese classical style of the 18th and early 19th century.</p>' +
			'<h2>Brazil\'s people</h2>' +
			'<p>Throughout its history, Brazil has welcomed several different peoples and practices. Brazil constitutes a melting pot of the most diverse ethnic groups thus mitigating ethnic prejudices and preventing racial conflicts, though long-lasting slavery and genocide among indigenous populations have taken their toll. Prejudice is sneaky since this matter is taboo in Brazil, and more directed towards different social classes than between races. Nevertheless, race, or simply skin colour, is still a dividing factor in Brazilian society and you will notice the skin typically darkens as the social class gets lower: wealthy upper-class people are almost all white; a few middle-class are mulato (mixed race) and even black; and the majority of poor people are black - except in South Region because blacks and mulatos compose less than 10% of its population. Nowadays, however, Afro-Brazilians and Amerindian populations are increasingly aware of their civil rights and of their rich cultural heritage, and social mobility is achievable through education.</p>' +
			'<p>In general, Brazilians are a fun-loving people. While Southerners may be somewhat colder and more reserved, from Rio upwards people usually boast a captivating attitude towards life and truly enjoy having a good time. Some may even tell you that beer, football, samba, barbecue and woman is all they could crave for.</p>' +
			'<p>Friendship and hospitality are highly praised traits, and family and social connections are strongly valued. To people they have met, or at least know by name, Brazilians are usually very open, friendly and sometimes quite generous. Once introduced, until getting a good reason not to, a typical Brazilian may treat you as warmly as he would treat a best friend. Brazilians are reputedly one of the most hospitable people in the world and foreigners are usually treated with respect and often with true admiration.<br>Attitudes towards foreigners may also be subject to some difference treatment: In most of cities, anyone talking, acting or looking like a tourist (even other Brazilians!) could be charged higher prices, such as in parking lots, in restaurants, open malls, etc.</p>',

	Story: '<p>France has been the world\'s most popular tourist destination for quite some time. It received 83.7 million visitors in 2014, although these figures are highly skewed by the number of people who frequent the country for the weekend, particularly to visit Disneyland Paris, Europe\'s most popular visitor attraction. France is one of the most geographically diverse countries in Europe, containing areas as different from each other as urban chic Paris, the sunny French Riviera, long Atlantic beaches, the winter sports resorts of the French Alps, the castles of the Loire Valley, rugged Celtic Brittany and the historian\'s dream that is Normandy.<br>France is a country of rich emotions and turbulent politics but also a place of rational thinking and Enlightenment treasures. Above all, it is renowned for its cuisine, culture and history.</p>' +
			'<p>In the Caribbean, France borders the Netherlands via the French territory of Saint-Martin which borders the Dutch territory of Sint Maarten. Five oversea regions also form part of France: Martinique and Guadeloupe in the Caribbean, French Guiana in South America, and Reunion and Mayotte, both off the coast of Madagascar. Numerous French oversea territories also exist around the Earth with varying status</p>' +
			'<h2>France Visa requirements</h2>' +
			'<p>Foreign nationals who are not visa-exempt (e.g. South Africans) must make a &quot;declaration of entry&quot; (d&#233;claration d\'entree) at a police station or to border inspection personnel if they arrive in France directly from another country of Schengen Area (e.g. Italy), unless they hold a long-term visa or residence permit issued by a Schengen member state. Their passports will be endorsed by the authorities to prove that such a declaration has been made.<br>If you intend to stay in France for longer than 90 days, regardless of purpose and with extremely few exceptions, an advance long-stay visa is always required of non-EEA or non-Swiss citizens. It is almost impossible to switch from a "C" (visitor) entry status to a "D" (long-stay) status from inside France, and you must apply for a long-stay visa in-person at the consulate responsible for your place of residence.</p>' +
			'<p>As of 2009, certain categories of long-stay visa, such as visitor (visiteur), family (vie privee et familiale), student (&#233;tudiant), intern (stagiaire), scientist/researcher (scientifique-chercheur), salaried worker (salari&#233;), and short-term worker (travailleur temporaire), do not require holders to obtain a separate residence permit (carte de s&#233;jour) for the first year of stay in France. However, the long-stay visa must be validated by the Office Fran&#231aise de l\'Immigration et de l\'Int&#233;gration (OFII) within the first three months of entering France to be valid for longer than those three months. This is done by sending in a form to the OFII received along with the visa with the address of residence in France, completing a medical examination, and attending an introductory meeting to validate the visa. The tax required for validation (&euro;58 for students and interns, but &euro;241 for workers <strong>except</strong> those under the short-term worker category and for scientists, visitors, and family) is, as of February 2013, collected at the end of the validation process inside France. This validated visa will serve as a residence permit and, likewise, allow travel throughout the other Schengen countries for up to 90 days in a six-month period. To stay in France after a validated visa expires, however, and/or if you hold a visa which states carte de s&#233;jour a solliciter d&#232;s l\'arriv&#233;e, a carte de s&#233;jour (residence permit card) must be obtained at the pr&#233;fecture responsible for your place of residence within two months of entry into France or two months before the visa expires. Please consult the OFII website for more information.<br>French overseas departments and territories (DOM-TOM) are not part of the Schengen Area and operate a separate immigration regime from mainland France. As such, if you intend to visit them, you will need a separate visa (if required for your nationality).</p>',

	Story: '<p>Imagine being three years old and skiing down a hillside for the first time. What an adventure! It was at this age one of our greatest alpine heroes, Aksel Lund Svindal, took on his first full day of skiing. The feeling is something he still treasures.<br>Norway is considered a skiing paradise by many, and not just because of the long season or the great snow conditions. The main reason is that <strong>there is something for everybody</strong> on offer here. Play in the children\'s slopes, cruise down a red piste, or chase the perfect powder further up in the mountains - the important thing is that you have fun when you do it.</p>' +
			'<p>You\'ll find family-friendly resorts all over the country, and most of them have ski schools and staff who are happy to teach the children to stay on their feet. Common to all facilities is that they work hard to be both safe and enjoyable at the same time. Many resorts have ski lifts literally right on your doorstep - which also means that you can ski all the way back to your room after a long day in the slopes. And after a quick change of clothes, you can lean back and relax with tasty and often local food and drinks in front of you.<br>If you want to explore different types of resorts, the country has a lot to choose from. Oslo offers a varied and exciting winter park just over 30 minutes from the city center, and several of the country\'s largest ski centres are located in Eastern Norway and <strong>within easy reach of the capital.</strong></p>' +
			'<p>In Northern Norway you can ski with large views of the sea. In Fjord Norway you\'ll find dramatic scenery with high peaks and <strong>fantastic possibilities for powder hunters</strong>. And if you want something more family-friendly than the latter, you and your children can enjoy a day of sun in a summer-open ski resort.<br>Aksel Lund Svindal has been skiing almost everywhere. He calls it an eye-opener to have travelled around the world, only to realize that Norway has some of the most wicked conditions on earth.</p>' +
			'<h2>The fjords - more than a pretty fa&#231;ade</h2>' +
			'<p>The stunning landscapes of Fjord Norway were created by a succession of ice ages, and the characteristic landscape hasn\'t changed a great deal since people started living here. <strong>Fjord arms and waterfalls are accessible virtually everywhere you go</strong>, and UNESCO has included the west Norwegian fjord landscape, exemplified by the Geirangerfjord and the N&aelig;r&oslash;yfjord, on its prestigious World Heritage List.<br>In Fjord Norway you\'ll find everything from desolate skerries to some of Norway\'s largest cities. A short drive is all it takes to go from urban life to quiet countryside or prime wilderness.</p>' +
			'<p>Along the sides and at the inner and outer ends of each fjord you\'ll find small communities and villages, <strong>each with its own speciality that reflects its local traditions</strong> and what was possible to grow in each place.<br><strong>Many of the region\'s fertile valleys are ideal for growing fruit</strong>, and apples, pears, cherries, and strawberries are popular and common crops. Wild game, fish, or locally reared sheep form the base of many a special dish from Fjord Norway.</p>',

	Story: '<p>As an island nation shut off from the rest of the world for a long time (with mild exceptions from China and Korea), Japan is very <strong>homogeneous</strong>. Almost 99% of the population is of Japanese ethnicity. The largest minority are Koreans, around 1 million strong, many in their 3rd or 4th generation. There are also sizable populations of Chinese, Filipinos and Brazilians, although many are of Japanese descent. Though largely assimilated, the resident Chinese population maintains a presence in Japan\'s three Chinatowns in Kobe, Nagasaki and Yokohama. Indigenous ethnic minorities include the <strong>Ainu</strong> on Hokkaido, gradually driven north during the centuries and now numbering around 50,000 (although the number varies greatly depending on the exact definition used), and the <strong>Ryukyuan</strong> people of Okinawa.</p>' +
			'<p>The Japanese are well known for their politeness. Many Japanese are thrilled to have visitors to their country and are incredibly helpful to lost and bewildered-looking foreigners. Younger Japanese people are often extremely interested in meeting and becoming friends with foreigners as well. Do not be surprised if a Japanese person (usually of the opposite gender) approaches you in a public place and tries to initiate a conversation with you in somewhat coherent English. On the other hand, many are not used to dealing with <strong>foreigners</strong> and are more reserved and reluctant to communicate.</p>' +
			'<p>Visibly foreign visitors remain a rarity in many parts of Japan outside of major cities, and you will likely encounter moments when entering a shop causes the staff to seemingly panic and scurry off into the back. Don\'t take this as racism or other xenophobia: they\'re just afraid that you\'ll try to address them in English and they\'ll be embarrassed because they can\'t understand or reply. A smile and a Konnichiwa (&quot;Hello&quot;) often helps.</p>' +
			'<h2>Religion in Japan</h2>' +
			'<p>Japan has two dominant religious traditions: <strong>Shinto</strong> is the ancient animist religion of traditional Japan, and Buddhism officially arrived in 552 CE. For much of its history, the two faiths were not clearly differentiated, but there was a schism when Buddhism lost favor with the fall of the Shogun and the subsequent modernization of the country in the late 19th century. Today, the two faiths are clearly separated, most Buddhist elements have long since been removed from most Shinto shrines, and the ceremonies are clearly separated.<br><strong>Christianity</strong> has never gained wide acceptance in Japan since Japan\'s opening to the world, and while it is no longer persecuted, only a small percentage of Japanese are Christian.</p>' +
			'<p>Generally speaking, the Japanese are not a particularly religious people. It is common to visit shrines and temples to offer coins and make silent prayers, and many homes often have a small shrine or display religious artifacts from various temples, but there is little mention of religious faith or dogma in daily life. Japanese people also tend not to think of religion as a matter of dogma or faith but rather as a matter of particular practices, and they will follow practices from various religions as it suits them, thus it would be impossible to try to represent what percentage of the population is Shinto versus Buddhist, or even Christian. According to a famous poll, Japan is 80% Shinto and 80% Buddhist, and another oft-quoted dictum states that Japanese are Shinto when they live, as weddings and festivals are typically Shinto, but Buddhist when they die, since funerals usually use Buddhist rites. Most Japanese accept a little bit of every religion. For example, Christmas decoration is probably more evident in Tokyo than New York, but there is little thought of Christ.</p>',
