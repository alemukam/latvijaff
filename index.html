		<h1>What is football freestyle ?</h1>
		<p>It may be referred to as the art of self-expression with a football when a freestyler performs various tricks with any part of the body. Why do we call it "art"? The answer is simple. Because there are no set standards what tricks <em>must</em> be performed in order to become successfull in the sport. Each freestyler chooses his or her own style, set of tricks on which to concentrate and tries to develop it. To be honest, the expression "no set standards" was not exactly correct because each discipline requires certain basic skills and the ability to land the easiest tricks, e.g. <strong>juggling</strong>. But there are so many tricks and combinations that a new freestyler can get overwhelmed by their number and it is exactly the fact why it is possible to develop your own style because there are many ways how tricks can be combined. One one said that you couldn't create your <strong>own tricks</strong>. That is why we call it art. And speaking about it. We mentioned that juggilng was essential in freestyle. And it is, but there is an exception. A Russian freestyler Akim Kovalev juggle only one (!) time before he performs his combinations and it doesn't prevent him from being one of the best hardcore lower freestylers in the whole world.</p>
		<p>Wait. What is hardcore? What is lower? These two words do not make any sense in this context. We are getting into it now. We said that a football freestyler could perform tricks with any part of the body. And that is the place where the sport is divided into the classic styles: Lowerbody/Air moves, Upperbody, Sitting/Sitdown and Goundmoves.</p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Lowerbody</strong> - commonly referred to as <em>"Lowers"</em>. Probably it is the most difficult style of the sport, but the most popular as well as it offers the biggest variety of tricks and combinations. If you are a newcomer to football freestyle, perhaps you have already come in touch with lowers. Have you ever tried to juggle the ball with your feet? If the answer is affirmitive it means you have already practised lowers. Most foorballers practise juggling during their trainings in order to improve the ball control. They can also perform some tricks while juggling. That all is called lowers. The most popular freestylers in lowers are <em>Luca Chiarvesio, Timur Alekseev, Pawe&#322; Sk&#243;ra, Tom Folan, Charly.</em></li>
			<li><strong>Upperbody</strong> - commonly referred to as <em>"Uppers"</em>. This style is not that popular as lowers across the world, but many freestylers in Russia and Japan devote most time of their training sessions to it. The easiest trick in uppers is head and neck stalls. What is this strange name? Have you ever tried to hold the football on your head or your neck? Or have you ever seen someone trying? If the answer is yes, then you have also seen some uppers. Of course all freestylers do more complicated tricks than these, but we will get into it later during trainings. Freestylers: <em>BenGau, Alexander Turlakov, Luki.</em></li>
			<li><strong>Sitting</strong> - commonly referred to as <em>"Sits"</em>. Its overall popularity is greater than uppers' because sits may be easier combined with lowers, however, non-freestylers (just a slang word to mark those who simply juggle the ball and do not freestyle seriously) rarely perform these tricks because these things are not common among footballers, i.e. non-freestylers. The most complicated part of sits is being unable to move completely because thefreestyles must sit. It makes the style quite difficult at the beginning because the ball is dropped all the time and the freestyler must stand up, go after the ball and sit dows again. Simple solution: practice in front of the wall. Freestylers: <em>Szymo, Charly, Jevgeny Baruzdin.</em></li>
			<li><strong>Groundmoves</strong> - commonly referred to as <em>"Grounds"</em>. One can draw a parallel between footbal and grounds. This style is about tricks when the ball is on the ground and is useful when one need to pass an opponent without losing the ball. Just like in football or in Panna tournaments. If you have tried to outperform anyone on the pitch in the showy manner, it means that you were doing grounds. It is difficult to highlight freestylers of this style because there are no freestylers who concentrate only on ground, but one such freestyler might be <em>Soufiane Bencok.</em></li>
		</ul>

		<p>In the recent times a new style has been introduced and it is called <strong>Special</strong>. And what's so special about it? Well, it is not the classic style of the sport and it refers to the acrobatic and break dance moves which are performed with a football. The most popular tricks are back- or frontflips with the ball and Jordan stall. This style is mainly used during performances they seem very spectacular to the crowd.</p>

		<h1>About the Team LatvijaFF</h1>
		<p>Team LatvijaFF is a football freestyle community which was established in Riga (Latvia) in 2015 by four local freestylers. The main goal of the community is to popularize the sport in Latvia by organizing various events, i.e. football freestyle meetings in Riga and other major cities and performances at different kinds of events. One of the biggest problems concerning football freestyle in Latvia is that the sport is not that popular as in other European countries and for quite a long time there have been no newcomers to the Latvian community. Therefore, the current short-term target is to establish the academy where everyone will have an opportunity to learn how to freestyle with a football.</p>
		<p>Even though the community was established in 2015, history of Latvian football freestyle had begun 8 years before it, i.e. in 2007 when <strong>Andrey Nosik</strong> (the current president of the LatvijaFF Community) started freestyling. He says: <em>"Like so many freestylers I had a passion about football. I was even playing for the local football team, but due to an injury I had to stop my career. It was a very hard moment in mylife because football was my life and it was impossible to imagine my life without it. Out of nowhere I found a video by Soufiane Touzani (it was the first football freestyle video ever) which has inspired me to try to do the same tricks. At the same evening I went outside and started juggling. And I was immediatelly hooked."</em></p>
		<p>For two years Andrey was the only freestyler (not a footballer who simply plays with the ball) and only in 2009 three more persons from started doing the sport - Fuad, Sergey and Misha. None of thew new that there were other freestylers in Latvia. They were training separately and have made some videos which were published on Vidogaga and it was only a matter of time when the four freestylers have got to know each other. On 4 September 2011 (International Football Freestyle day) the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGnpWgiwXhU" target="_blank" title="The First Meeting in Riga">first Riga meeting</a> was held at Esplanade.
